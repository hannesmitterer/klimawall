Based on your repo’s code and content, here are targeted recommendations to optimize and improve both the content functions and graphics:

Content Functions

Refactor Repeated Logic: The show/hide details logic for your interactive SVG is well structured but can be further modularized. Consider separating UI update logic and animation logic into smaller functions for easier maintenance and testing.
Accessibility: Ensure that the interactive SVG components are keyboard accessible (e.g., add tabindex and ARIA attributes), so users can navigate and activate them without a mouse.
Content Richness: Expand descriptions in the ecosystemData object to provide more actionable insights, FAQs, or troubleshooting tips. Consider fetching this data dynamically (from a CMS or JSON file) for easier updates.
Localization: If you plan for multiple languages, structure content data to support easy translation.
Example Improvement:

JavaScript
// Accessibility improvements for SVG components
['power-core', 'smart-hub', 'mobile-app'].forEach(comp => {
  const el = document.getElementById(comp);
  el.setAttribute('tabindex', '0');
  el.setAttribute('role', 'button');
  el.setAttribute('aria-label', ecosystemData[comp].title);
  el.addEventListener('keydown', e => {
    if (e.key === 'Enter' || e.key === ' ') showDetails(comp);
  });
});
Graphics

SVG Optimization:
Simplify SVG paths and shapes for faster rendering and smaller file size.
Use CSS for hover effects instead of inline SVG styles for better performance and maintainability.
Responsive Design: Ensure SVG and surrounding containers scale smoothly on all screen sizes. Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
Visual Hierarchy: Use color, shadow, and animation to emphasize important components. For example, animate the active box with a subtle glow or pulse when selected.
Data-Driven Visuals: For the campaign progress chart, replace the placeholder image with a dynamic SVG or chart library (e.g., Chart.js or D3.js) to display real data.
Example SVG Enhancement:

HTML
<rect id="power-core" ... class="ecosystem-component hover:fill-yellow-400 focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500"/>
And in CSS:

CSS
.ecosystem-component:focus {
  outline: none;
  stroke: #2563eb;
  stroke-width: 6;
}
General Recommendations

Performance: Minimize JavaScript and CSS bundle size; use minification and lazy loading for assets.
User Feedback: Add transitions and feedback for interactions (e.g., loading spinners, tooltips).
Documentation: Expand your README with examples, screenshots, and usage tips so contributors and users understand interactive features quickly.
Would you like a pull request with these improvements implemented in your code? If so, specify which area to prioritize (content logic, graphics/SVG, accessibility, or all of them)!
